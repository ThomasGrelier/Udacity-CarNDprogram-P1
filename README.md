This repository is dedicated to the first project of the first term of Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree program.
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Objective is to detect lane lines on the road. This is done using Python and OpenCV.
A pipeline is developed and is applied to a series of images and videos.
Python source code is provided in the jupyter notebook "P1-code.ipynb"

A writeup is also provided (P1-writeup.md) which detaills the different steps of the pipeline, provides results for the series of images, and finally identifies weaknesses of the algorithm and provides proposals of improvement.
