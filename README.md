[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the first project of the first term of Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree program.

Objective is to detect lane lines on the road. This is done using Python and OpenCV.
A pipeline is developed and is applied to a series of images and videos.
Python source code is provided in the jupyter notebook "P1-code.ipynb"

A writeup is also provided (P1-writeup.md) which detaills the different steps of the pipeline, provides results for the series of images, and finally identifies weaknesses of the algorithm and provides proposals of improvement.

## Repository content

The repository includes the following files:

* P1-code.ipynb: jupyter notebook of the project
* P1-writeup.md: writeup of the project

And one directory:

* _/test\_images\_output_: images displayed in the report

## Dependencies
